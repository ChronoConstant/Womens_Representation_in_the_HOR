# Womens Representation in the House of Representatives by Party Afilliation
A visual story of women's representation in the U.S. House of Representatives over time by party.
This visualization is to provide a look at the growing disparity between the parties in their amount of elected women over the last 50 years.
The goal was to improve upon the previous graph from the same data and make the data more readable.

Changes Made:
- Extend the timeline further back to demonstrate the painfully slow growth in both parties preceding the Democrats emergence as the leader in womens leadership.
- Change format to a bar graph to more clearly show the earlier similarities and then the later disparities in womens representation in the two parties.
- Included labels on the Y-axis to give a better frame of reference for where the parties sat over the years

Major Takeaways:
- This Graph begins in 1969 when there were only a handful of female representatives in both parties and demonstrates that the pace of change up to the early 90's was horrifically slow or non-existant.
- The higher numbers we see now are a relatively recent occurance that didnt begin to gain momentum until around 30 years ago.
- The steadily increasing gap between the parties is a frightening occurance.
- 35% of seats in either party isn't close to enough. Women make up more than half the population and you'd expect
 to see their representation match their population in both parties.
